Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. 

"Kind, good little girl," said her grandmother, "just look here: I have made you a little cap of red velvet, and it becomes you so well that wherever you go everyone calls you Little Red Riding Hood."

So she was always called by that name. One day her mother said to her, "Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother; she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing. And when you go into her room, don't forget to say, 'Good morning,' and donâ€™t peep into every corner before you do it."

"I will take great care," said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.
